2022-08-14	Expanding Neuro-Symbolic AI for Strategic Learning	KDD Undergraduate Consortium	Today, artificial intelligence (AI) solves problems as varied as driving cars to diagnosing diseases. However, it still has significant pitfalls. This paper will seek to apply neuro-symbolic AI to strategic game play where AI agents have the same information as a human playerâ€”just an image.
